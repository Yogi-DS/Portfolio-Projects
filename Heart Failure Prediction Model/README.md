# Heart Failure Prediction
The main objective of this project is to design a robust system which works efficiently and will able to predict the possibility of heart failure accurately. This paper uses the dataset originally from the UCI repository and having 11 important attributes but the combined version of dataset available in Kaggle with 918 unique observations was used.

This project on predictive analytics on heart failure has followed CRISP-DM model for data understanding, modeling, and evaluation. Python programming language is used to load, explore, and model the prediction system along with necessary machine learning libraries for Python.

### Models Created
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost Ensemble
- Logistic Regression

**AdaBoost Ensemble model yielded the best result i.e. Accuracy with 90%.**

### Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
