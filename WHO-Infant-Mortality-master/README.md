### Method & Results

I obtained my data from the World Health Organization website. (The ICD-10 coding scheme proved particularly problematic.) Once the data was cleaned and munged, it was converted into lists and charts that uncovered some interesting insights. For example, among more developed nations, the leading cause of death was generally less known.

I also worked alongside one Nelson Cooper to produce a script that could summon the leading causes of infant mortality for a particular country, by simply substituting in the country name.
