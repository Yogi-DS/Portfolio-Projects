# Movie Recommender Model in R using Machine Learning

This project is built on R program using IMDB datasets with movies name and their ratings. This recommender model uses Collaborative Filtering system to recommend the movie.

Utilizing preferences gathered from numerous other users, collaborative filtering involves recommending movies to consumers.For instance, if user A and user B both enjoy action movies, then A will be recommended the movies that B will watch in the future, and vice versa. Therefore, establishing a commonality between the two consumers is necessary for making movie recommendations. 
I calculated similarities using a variety of operators, including cosine and pearson with the aid of recommenderlab.
