# Employee Evaluation - A Machine Learning approach
This project is aimed to evaluate the employees' various parameters to determine whether they're eligible for promotion. Project is based on data exploration and building a classification model using machine learning algorithms.

The Human Resources department has a big role in ensuring that an organization's promotions process is well functioning and managed by helping to guide employees' futures, maintaining clear policies and keeping workers engaged when they're not promoted.
Poor promotions practices can create dissatisfaction, high turnover and even law suits of discrimination if employees believe they've been passed over unfairly.
Hiring and placing the best candidates for available positions is one the most important part of ensuring a company's success.
Filling roles or promoting from within your organization is one way you can promote long term retention, increase productivity, loyalty and dedication and reward employees for strong performances.

For the organization or a company having thousands of employees, it is quite a challenge to evaluate each individual for the eligibility of their promotion.
So, there's a need to utilize the stored data in HR department to make a predictive model, which will help predict if a person is eligible for promotion or not.

### Dataset
For this project work in this term, I've chosen a dataset containing details of 54 thousand employees from different departments. I've acquired this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/muhammadimran112233/employees-evaluation-for-promotion). It has following 13 columns:

• employeeid: Unique ID for the employee <br>
• department: Department of employee <br>
• region: Region of employment <br>
• education: Education Level <br>
• gender: Gender of Employee <br>
• recruitmentchannel: Channel of recruitment for employee<br>
• no_of_trainings: Number of other trainings completed.<br>
• age: Age of Employee<br>
• previous_year_ rating: Employee Rating for the previous year<br>
• length_of_service: Length of service in years<br>
• awards_won: if awards won during the previous year then 1 else 0<br>
• avg_training_score: Average score in current training evaluations<br>
• is_promoted: Recommended for promotion
